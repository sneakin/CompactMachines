Compact Machines [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thraaawn/CompactMachines.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thraaawn/CompactMachines)
================

Adds one simple game mechanic: Small rooms inside of blocks.
It basically gives you the ability to build your contraptions inside of a single block.

Each side of a Compact Machine has a small buffer for items, fluids and Redstone Flux
allowing the room to interact with the outside. Applied Energistics channels, Project
Red bundled cables and OpenComputers cables are supported as well. The room has the
corresponding counter parts on its walls.


Your first room
===============

* Craft yourself a compact machine
* Right click it with a "Personal Shrinking Device"
* Use the interfaces in the walls to access the buffers
* Right click again to leave the block.


State of the mod
================

Current testing shows the mod is quite stable - at least no major bug reports in the last
weeks. It still might screw your worlds, though it is unlikely. I might also add
some world breaking stuff later on, but you will be warned if that should happen. Also
unlikely though.
This mod is still in beta and I expect a few bugs here and there, feedback is
much appreciated on the GitHub issue tracker. As are pull requests obviously :)


Blocks and Items
================

Compact Machines, 6 sizes
--------------------------
Surround a World Resizing Cube with one of the following materials:

* Wood gives you a 3x3x3 room
* Iron, 5x5x5
* Gold, 7x7x7
* Obsidian, 9x9x9
* Diamond, 11x11x11
* Nether Star, 13x13x13

Personal Shrinking Device
-------------------------
Required to enter/leave a block. Don't lose yours while you are working inside of a
machine or you might get trapped.

Quantum Entangler
-------------------------
Use it to link two machines to the same room. They share the same content and buffers.
Both machines must be upgraded with a netherstar and must be of the same size. You
cannot entangle two used machines, i.e. the target machine must never have been
entered before.

This mod would not have been possible without the following open source mods:

* [Enderstorage](https://github.com/Chicken-Bones/EnderStorage) (helped with inventory + fluid handling across dimensions)
* [CodeChickenCore/Lib](https://github.com/Chicken-Bones?tab=repositories) (helped with Inventory, Fluid utils, Chunkloading)
* [Minefactory Reloaded](https://github.com/skyboy/MineFactoryReloaded/) (helped with drawing tanks+energy on GUIs)
* [Random Things](https://github.com/lumien231/Random-Things/) (helped with dimension handling)
* [EquivalentExchange](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3/) + LetsModReboot (how to get started)
* [PowerConverters](https://github.com/covers1624/PowerConverters) for inspiration + [sneakin](http://twitter.com/sneakin/) for IC2 support.

All of these mods provided code for certain features or at least ideas on how to tackle
some implementations. Again, this mod would not have been possible without the fantastic
work of their authors. Thank you guys a lot.
I would also like to thank everyone who contributed directly in some way, e.g. the translators
and others who helper promote the mod.
